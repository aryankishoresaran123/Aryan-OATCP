1# Read input from the file input1.txt and write output to output1.txt.
2# Read the sorted integer array nums from the input file.
3# Read the integer n from standard input.
4# Initialize variables n2 as the size of nums, maxreach as 0 (representing the maximum reachable number), and ans as 0 (representing the number of patches required).
5# Iterate over each element num in nums using a for loop:
    a. Check if num is greater than (maxreach + 1).
    b. If true, update maxreach by setting it to (2 * maxreach + 1) and increment ans by 1.
    c. If maxreach becomes greater than or equal to n, return ans as the result.
    d. Otherwise, add num to maxreach.
    e. Again, if maxreach becomes greater than or equal to n, return ans as the result.
6# If the loop completes and maxreach is still less than n, enter a while loop:
7# Update maxreach by setting it to (2 * maxreach + 1) and increment ans by 1.
8# Return ans as the final result.
